# How to help out!

# Bugs/Issues
Use the "Issues" tab on GitHub. Create an issue with the "bug" label, and we will work on it as soon as possible! 

# Suggestions

Use the "Issues" tab on GitHub. Create and issue with the "Enhancement" label, and if it is a good idea to us (and not really hard to code), we will add it!

# Coding the game!

If you feel like you have something to add to the game, we are open to help. Although, plase wait a couple weeks to speak up, as we are using this as a school project. Once it is over (likely end of June), we will be open to any help you have. Submit a Pull Request, and if we think you are great, we will add you to the team!

# Thanks!
