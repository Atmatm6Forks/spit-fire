# spit-fire

NOTE : As of build/commit 102 (or Alpha 2), PIL (Python Image Library) is required to run spit-fire!!!!



This is our first game we ever made so it is probabally not the best,but we both put alot of time and effort into this


We hope to make more

# How to run spit-fire

Run main.py in Python 3 to start the game.
You need pygame, and PIL (Python Image Library) (preferrably the latest versions) installed to run the game.
If you want, you can run run_main.py.bat in the root of the repo for a quick start script.
